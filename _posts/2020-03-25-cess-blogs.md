Hi! I am Cess. I am starting a new life at 30. Well I am still 29 as of this writing but I am more excited to be turning a year older now in a few months time.

My story is a common tale of a plain housewife and stay at home mom. I am a wife to a tech geek who is a very hardworking husband. I am a mom to 2 beautiful and energetic kids, a 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl. I am a homemaker who loves to cook hearty meals, enjoys organising and cleaning our home, prepares activities for my kids and takes care of my husbands needs. This has been my norm for almost 5 years.

But this is also a story of a woman who is struggling with her quarter life crisis and trying to find purpose and meaning in life. As I turn a year older this 2020, I have decided to reconnect with my self and to come out of my comfort zone to do things I have never done, to meet new friends, to regain my passion for arts, design and nature, to find new passion, and to look for inspiration and be an inspiration to the women who are also like me.

I decided to create this blog to spread positivity by sharing my love for family, plants, organizing,  learning, arts and crafts, travelling, food, nature and so much more. Also, Iâ€™d like to have an outlet and to document my story and new explorations that I will be heading to. 

30 is my new 20. It may sound cliche, but anyone can start their own new journey at any age and time they are ready. :)
