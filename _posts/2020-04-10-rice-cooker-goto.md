title: Rice Cooker Goto
---
It is rainy today here in Singapore and I have decided to prepare _Goto_ for my family. It is one of our most favorite comfort foods and we really miss eating it. Well, lugaw, arroz caldo and goto are our favorites when it comes to merienda and rainy season food. You can easily find these meriendas in the Philippines almost everywhere, most of the carenderias have these foods on their menu.  

Goto, like lugaw, is a rice porridge or congee, but the difference is it has beef tripes and sometimes pig innards in it. Lugaw is just plain rice porridge. Arrozcaldo on the other hand is cooked with chicken as meat and broth. If you know how to cook lugaw, you can also easily cook this sumptuous merienda.

Singapore also has rice porridge foods but the taste of course is different from what we Filipinos are used to. One of the rice porridge that I have tried here is the _Chicken Shredded Porridge_ which is by far the best rice porridge I have tasted here. But since we missed Filipino Goto I tried to cook it for my family.

As I wanted to do more while cooking, I decided to let the rice cooker do most of the cooking. Our rice cooker has a slow cook and rice porridge cook setting. I did not hesitate to cook our goto in it. Preparation will be more than 2 hours so you need to prepare ahead if you are planning to eat it at a desired time. Cooking time will be at least 45 mins to an hour depending on your desired consistency of goto. Don't worry as you won't need to always check and stir your goto while preparing and cooking. That being said, you can do other things while cooking your goto. :)

**Here are the ingredients you need:**
- Beef tripes 500 grams
- Uncooked rice 1 ½ cup
- Water 7 cups
- 1 beef cube
- 1 pork cube
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 small onion minced
- salt and pepper
- patis 
- for toppings: hard-boiled egg, green onions, toasted garlic and crushed chicharon

**Procedure**
  1. Clean the beef stripes. Generously apply salt and rub it on the tripe. Rinse it under running water and repeat it at least 2 times.
  2. Using the rice cooker pot, combine 7 cups of water and salt and the tripe. Boil for 2  hours using the slow cook setting. Set aside the tripes and liquid separately. Rinse the pot.*
  3. Combine the onion, garlic and ginger in the rice cooker pot. Add the tripes. Pour in the broth that you set aside. Put in 1 beef and 1 pork cubes and 1 teaspoon turmeric powder.
  5. Cook for about 45 mins to an hour or until the desired rice porridge consistency is achieved and when the tripes are soft enough.
  6. Add salt, pepper and patis to taste.
  7. Transfer to a serving bowl. Add egg, green onions and toasted garlic, and crushed chicharon. You can also pair it with tokwa’t baboy.
  8. Serve and enjoy eating! :)
  
This recipe is good for 4-5 servings.

Note: *You can also use a standard rice cooker in this recipe. When the rice cooker reaches its boiling point it automatically changes the setting from cook to warm. You just have to use the warm setting when cooking. Leave it there for at least 3 hours or until the desired texture is achieved.
